# Agents

Custom agent configurations for Claude Code.

## What are Agents?

Agents are specialized configurations that define how Claude handles specific types of tasks. They can include system prompts, tool permissions, and behavioral guidelines.

## Directory Structure

Each agent should have its own directory:

```
agents/
├── agent-name/
│   ├── agent.md       # Agent configuration and instructions
│   └── README.md      # Documentation for the agent
```

## Creating an Agent

1. Create a new directory with your agent name
2. Add an `agent.md` file with the agent's configuration
3. Add a `README.md` documenting the agent's purpose and usage
