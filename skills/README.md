# Skills

Custom skills for Claude Code.

## What are Skills?

Skills are reusable prompt templates that extend Claude Code's capabilities. They can be invoked using `/skill-name` syntax.

## Directory Structure

Each skill should have its own directory:

```
skills/
├── skill-name/
│   ├── skill.md       # The skill prompt/instructions
│   └── README.md      # Documentation for the skill
```

## Creating a Skill

1. Create a new directory with your skill name
2. Add a `skill.md` file with the skill's instructions
3. Add a `README.md` documenting usage and examples
